# turtle-crossing
This is the capstone project that is essentially a fun game where multiple cars move from left to right. As the player, represented by a Turtle character, the objective is to cross the road without colliding with any of the cars.

I included both Zip file and single file of this capstone project so you can download and have fun playing this game.
